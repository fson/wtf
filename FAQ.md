# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is this production-ready?

Yes.

## Does it scale?

Ok.

## Why did you create this library?

I felt a need for a simpler mental model to use to build Spa applications.

## Is this library a joke?

The name might be reminiscent to a popular pejorative language feature, but rest assured JavaScript is a language I believe will be ruling computation still for a couple of years, maybe even decades, who knows. This is a small world and you never know who you'll bump into next. ;)
